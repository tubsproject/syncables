  description: >-
    Multi-tenancy API for e-invoicing services. This API is work in progress and
    may contain faulty or incomplete documentation.


    ## How to read this API

    The API is structured in two sections, the first section is the API
    endpoints and the second section is the data types. In the data type section
    all properties for the full datatypes are listed and described. Different
    endpoints are then using different subsets of the full datatypes, e.g. a
    read endpoint typically returns more properties than an update endpoint, so
    each endpoint lists the subset of the datatype that applies to that
    endpoint.

        **Lowest role:** <code>orgmember</code>


        **Datatype:** [Organisation](#model-Organisation)


        ### Mode Change Workflow


        **Request mode change (org admin):**

        - Set <code>modeChangeRequest</code> to desired mode (WHITELABEL or
        SHARED)

        - Validates against current <code>organisationMode</code>

        - DEMO can request WHITELABEL or SHARED

        - WHITELABEL can request SHARED

        - SHARED cannot request changes


        **Approve mode change (superadmin only):**

        - Set <code>organisationMode</code> to requested mode

        - Automatically clears <code>modeChangeRequest</code>


        **Reject mode change (superadmin only):**

        - Set <code>modeChangeRequest</code> to null

An Access Point can be created in one of two ways: System-generated AP URL or selfHostedApUrl. If no external URL is provided, the platform generates and assigns an AP URL automatically. Alternatively, you may provide a custom selfHostedApUrl if you want to use your own external access point infrastructure.

          Updates an existing Access Point (AP). The certificate must exist and have service type "AP". An Access Point can be created in one of two ways: System-generated AP URL or selfHostedApUrl. If no external URL is provided, the platform generates and assigns an AP URL automatically. Alternatively, you may provide a custom selfHostedApUrl if you want to use your own external access point infrastructure.
