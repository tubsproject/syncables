    ## Introduction


    This is the API documentation for ion-AP, the Peppol/AS4 access point.


    ## General information


    The API is discoverable and has an interactive version: simply visit the
    base API url in a browser and you can interact with it directly.


    There are three types of API endpoints: direct resources, resource lists,
    and actions (such as send-document).


    ### Resource objects


    Resource objects are generally recognized by the URI being singular.


    Resource objects contain serialized information about the relevant resource.
    By default, they will also include a links object, containing links relevant

    to the requested resource.


    The 'self' link always shows the canonical URL of the resource itself. This
    is useful when these resources are encountered in a resource list context. 

    Usually, there are context-specific other actions or resources in the links
    as well.


    Most resources return a serialized form of the resource in JSON format.
    There are a few exceptions: when direct XML is requested (such as a sent
    Document or 

    an SBDH), only application/xml is supported.


    You can disable the links being included on any page with the query
    parameter `disable_links=1`


    ### Resource lists


    For consistency, any list endpoint is paginated, even if those list
    endpoints that are expected to be small. Pagination objects contain the
    following parts:


    - count: The total number of elements

    - next: The URL of the next set of elements (if any)

    - previous: The URL of the previous set of elements (if any)


    Pagination can be influenced with the following query parameters:


    - offset: The index of the starting element of the returned set (starting at
    0)

    - limit: The number of items to return


    By default, the offset is 0, and the limit is 10.


    You can disable pagination on any page with a query parameter:
    `disable_pagination=1`.


    ### Actions


    Actions are generally recognized by the URI being a verb.


    If an action creates an object as a side effect, this object will be
    returned in JSON format. For instance, `send-document` creates and schedules
    a send 

    transaction, so this action will return the same as requesting the details
    of one through the send-transaction/ endpoint.


    ## Error responses


    Errors responses have the corresponding HTTP code set, but also include the
    following content:

        {
            "type": "client_error|server_error|",
            "errors": [
                {
                    "code": "error_code",
                    "detail": "Error details.",
                    "attr": <optional attributes>
                }
            ]
        }

    For consistency, this format is also used for singular errors, such as 404
    results.


    ## Authentication


    Applications have three options to authenticate to ion-AP:


    1. JWT

    2. API Token, configured per user

    3. Basic HTTP session authentication


    JWT is used by the front-end as well, and is considered the most secure
    method of authentication, due to the tokens expiring automatically. When
    using the `obtain_jwt_token` request, you receive an access token and a
    refresh token.


    The access token is used in subsequence requests by using the header:


    `Authorization: JWT <access token>`


    The access token is valid for 1 hour, but you can create a new one by using
    the refresh token with the `refresh_jwt_token` endpoint.



    API Tokens do not expire, but need to be created in an authenticated session
    before they can be used (either through the web interface or with a one-off
    other authentication method).


    API Tokens are used through the Authorization header, with the Token
    identifier:


    `Authorization: Token <your API token>`.


    For instance, if your token is 69206a9c9fa6c7c9156133a5f2839028ffa4e538, the
    full header would be:


    `Authorization: Token 69206a9c9fa6c7c9156133a5f2839028ffa4e538`



    Basic HTTP session authentication is considered the least secure option,
    since it places the username and password in every request.


    You can use basic authentication with the header


    `Authorization: Basic <base64-encoding of username:password>`

        Organizations, or Trading Entities, are the senders and receivers of
        documents on the peppol network.


        Organizations have one or more Peppol Identifiers, such as a Chamber of
        Commerce number or a VAT number.


        Users can, depending on their account type and role permissions, send
        and receive document on behalf of

        zero, one, or multiple organizations.


        This endpoint manages the organization entries for an account
        themselves.

        Organizations, or Trading Entities, are the senders and receivers of
        documents on the peppol network.


        Organizations have one or more Peppol Identifiers, such as a Chamber of
        Commerce number or a VAT number.


        Users can, depending on their account type and role permissions, send
        and receive document on behalf of

        zero, one, or multiple organizations.


        This endpoint manages the organization entries for an account
        themselves.

      description: >-
        Receive triggers are actions that ion-AP can take when an organization
        receives a document on the peppol network.


        To configure a receive trigger, you must set a trigger type and,
        depending on the type, a number of arguments.


        Note that these are likely to be expanded, and possibly changed, in the
        near future. If you have any specific requests,

        please let us know.


        There are currently two trigger types implemented:


        - API_CALL: ion-ap performs a web API call to a remote endpoint, to
        notify of the received document.

        - SEND_EMAIL: ion-ap sends an email to a configured e-mail address, with
        a notification that a document has been received.


        API_CALL has the following arguments:

        - url: The remote URL of the call

        - method: GET or POST: the HTTP method that the call will use

        - post_data: one of the following values:
          - document: The HTTP POST method will set the Content-Type header to application/xml, and POST the received document
          - sbdh: The HTTP POST method will set the Content-Type header to application/xml, and POST the entire received SBDH
          - fetch-url-transaction: The HTTP POST method will send an x-www-form-urlencoded data object, with a single field containing the API Resource URL to fetch the transaction data. The name of the field defaults to 'data', but can be set with the argument 'post_field_name'
        - post_field_name: For post_data arguments that send an
        x-www-form-urlencoded form, this argument specified the name of the
        field containing the configured data. Defaults to 'data'.


        SEND_EMAIL has the following arguments:

        - recipient: The email address to which the email messages are sent

        - attach_document: The received document will be attached to the email
        (as an xml file)

        - attach_sbdh: The full SBDH of the received document will be attached
        to the email (as an xml file)

        - attach_pdf: A pdf conversion of the received document will be attached
        to the email (experimental, only for invoices)

        - subject: A template for the subject of the email, defaults to "Peppol
        document received for %RECEIVER_NAME% from %SENDER_NAME%"

        - body: A template for the body of the email, defaults to "You have
        received a peppol document from %SENDER_NAME%. The API resource URL is:
        %API_RESOURCE_URL%"


        The email subject and body are templates, in which the following
        keywords are automatically replaced:

        - %SENDER_NAME%: The name of the sending organization

        - %RECEIVER_NAME%: The name of the receiving organization

        - %API_RESOURCE_URL%: The API Resource URL that returns the details of
        the receive transaction



        There are also arguments to all trigger types:

        - only_on_document_type: <string> Only execute the trigger when the full
        document type from the transaction matches

        - only_on_xml_type: <string> only execute the trigger when the XML of
        the document in the transaction matches the (optional) namespace and
        root element, format: xml namespace::<root element>. Yopu can use * to
        match all XML namespaces, or all root elements (e.g. *::Invoice, or
        urn:ns:example::*)

        - only_on_sender_id: <string> only execute the trigger if the sender
        matches this identifier

        - only_on_receiver_id: <string> only execute the trigger if the receiver
        matches this identifier

        - only_on_no_other_triggers: <boolean> only executes if there were no
        other triggers executed for this transaction. This excepts other
        triggers that had this requirement set (i.e. if there are multiple
        triggers with this setting set, they are all executed).


        If you specify multiple 'only_on' arguments for a trigger, they must all
        match in order for the trigger to be executed; their values are a
        logical AND.

        If you want a logical OR, you can specify multiple triggers, where only
        the 'only_on' values differ.


        Note that there is a difference between not specifying any only_on
        arguments (the trigger will always be executed) and using
        'only_otherwise' (the trigger will only be executed if no other triggers
        were).

        Receive triggers are actions that ion-AP can take when an organization
        receives a document on the peppol network.


        To configure a receive trigger, you must set a trigger type and,
        depending on the type, a number of arguments.


        Note that these are likely to be expanded, and possibly changed, in the
        near future. If you have any specific requests,

        please let us know.


        There are currently two trigger types implemented:


        - API_CALL: ion-ap performs a web API call to a remote endpoint, to
        notify of the received document.

        - SEND_EMAIL: ion-ap sends an email to a configured e-mail address, with
        a notification that a document has been received.


        API_CALL has the following arguments:

        - url: The remote URL of the call

        - method: GET or POST: the HTTP method that the call will use

        - post_data: one of the following values:
          - document: The HTTP POST method will set the Content-Type header to application/xml, and POST the received document
          - sbdh: The HTTP POST method will set the Content-Type header to application/xml, and POST the entire received SBDH
          - fetch-url-transaction: The HTTP POST method will send an x-www-form-urlencoded data object, with a single field containing the API Resource URL to fetch the transaction data. The name of the field defaults to 'data', but can be set with the argument 'post_field_name'
        - post_field_name: For post_data arguments that send an
        x-www-form-urlencoded form, this argument specified the name of the
        field containing the configured data. Defaults to 'data'.


        SEND_EMAIL has the following arguments:

        - attach_pdf: A pdf conversion of the received document will be attached
        to the email (experimental, only for invoices)

        - subject: A template for the subject of the email, defaults to "Peppol
        document received for %RECEIVER_NAME% from %SENDER_NAME%"

        - body: A template for the body of the email, defaults to "You have
        received a peppol document from %SENDER_NAME%. The API resource URL is:
        %API_RESOURCE_URL%"


        The email subject and body are templates, in which the following
        keywords are automatically replaced:

        - %SENDER_NAME%: The name of the sending organization

        - %RECEIVER_NAME%: The name of the receiving organization

        - %API_RESOURCE_URL%: The API Resource URL that returns the details of
        the receive transaction



        There are also arguments to all trigger types:

        - only_on_document_type: <string> Only execute the trigger when the full
        document type from the transaction matches

        - only_on_xml_type: <string> only execute the trigger when the XML of
        the document in the transaction matches the (optional) namespace and
        root element, format: xml namespace::<root element>. Yopu can use * to
        match all XML namespaces, or all root elements (e.g. *::Invoice, or
        urn:ns:example::*)

        - only_on_sender_id: <string> only execute the trigger if the sender
        matches this identifier

        - only_on_receiver_id: <string> only execute the trigger if the receiver
        matches this identifier

        - only_on_no_other_triggers: <boolean> only executes if there were no
        other triggers executed for this transaction. This excepts other
        triggers that had this requirement set (i.e. if there are multiple
        triggers with this setting set, they are all executed).


        If you specify multiple 'only_on' arguments for a trigger, they must all
        match in order for the trigger to be executed; their values are a
        logical AND.

        If you want a logical OR, you can specify multiple triggers, where only
        the 'only_on' values differ.


        Note that there is a difference between not specifying any only_on
        arguments (the trigger will always be executed) and using
        'only_otherwise' (the trigger will only be executed if no other triggers
        were).

        Receive triggers are actions that ion-AP can take when an organization
        receives a document on the peppol network.


        To configure a receive trigger, you must set a trigger type and,
        depending on the type, a number of arguments.


        Note that these are likely to be expanded, and possibly changed, in the
        near future. If you have any specific requests,

        please let us know.


        There are currently two trigger types implemented:


        - API_CALL: ion-ap performs a web API call to a remote endpoint, to
        notify of the received document.

        - SEND_EMAIL: ion-ap sends an email to a configured e-mail address, with
        a notification that a document has been received.


        API_CALL has the following arguments:

        - url: The remote URL of the call

        - method: GET or POST: the HTTP method that the call will use

        - post_data: one of the following values:
          - document: The HTTP POST method will set the Content-Type header to application/xml, and POST the received document
          - sbdh: The HTTP POST method will set the Content-Type header to application/xml, and POST the entire received SBDH
          - fetch-url-transaction: The HTTP POST method will send an x-www-form-urlencoded data object, with a single field containing the API Resource URL to fetch the transaction data. The name of the field defaults to 'data', but can be set with the argument 'post_field_name'
        - post_field_name: For post_data arguments that send an
        x-www-form-urlencoded form, this argument specified the name of the
        field containing the configured data. Defaults to 'data'.


        SEND_EMAIL has the following arguments:

        - recipient: The email address to which the email messages are sent

        - attach_document: The received document will be attached to the email
        (as an xml file)

        - attach_sbdh: The full SBDH of the received document will be attached
        to the email (as an xml file)

        - attach_pdf: A pdf conversion of the received document will be attached
        to the email (experimental, only for invoices)

        - subject: A template for the subject of the email, defaults to "Peppol
        document received for %RECEIVER_NAME% from %SENDER_NAME%"

        - body: A template for the body of the email, defaults to "You have
        received a peppol document from %SENDER_NAME%. The API resource URL is:
        %API_RESOURCE_URL%"


        The email subject and body are templates, in which the following
        keywords are automatically replaced:

        - %SENDER_NAME%: The name of the sending organization

        - %RECEIVER_NAME%: The name of the receiving organization

        - %API_RESOURCE_URL%: The API Resource URL that returns the details of
        the receive transaction



        There are also arguments to all trigger types:

        - only_on_document_type: <string> Only execute the trigger when the full
        document type from the transaction matches

        - only_on_xml_type: <string> only execute the trigger when the XML of
        the document in the transaction matches the (optional) namespace and
        root element, format: xml namespace::<root element>. Yopu can use * to
        match all XML namespaces, or all root elements (e.g. *::Invoice, or
        urn:ns:example::*)

        - only_on_sender_id: <string> only execute the trigger if the sender
        matches this identifier

        - only_on_receiver_id: <string> only execute the trigger if the receiver
        matches this identifier

        - only_on_no_other_triggers: <boolean> only executes if there were no
        other triggers executed for this transaction. This excepts other
        triggers that had this requirement set (i.e. if there are multiple
        triggers with this setting set, they are all executed).


        If you specify multiple 'only_on' arguments for a trigger, they must all
        match in order for the trigger to be executed; their values are a
        logical AND.

        If you want a logical OR, you can specify multiple triggers, where only
        the 'only_on' values differ.


        Note that there is a difference between not specifying any only_on
        arguments (the trigger will always be executed) and using
        'only_otherwise' (the trigger will only be executed if no other triggers
        were).

        This can either be a Standard Business Document XML file, including the
        full SBD Header, or it can be just the document itself, in which

        case the SBD Envelope will be generated automatically. The latter only
        works for support XML files, such as UBL or CII Invoices and
        CreditNotes.


        For supported documents, a number of checks are performed, such as that
        it is does not have validation errors, and that you are allowed to send

        the document (whether you have the right access for sender identifier in
        the document).


        If so, a SendTransaction is created, and the document will be scheduled
        for sending. You can retrieve the status of the send transaction with

        the relevant resource URI.
