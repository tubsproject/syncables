  description: >-

    Welcome to the Recommand Peppol API documentation. This API provides a
    comprehensive set of endpoints for managing and interacting with the
    Recommand Peppol platform.


    ## Getting Started


    To get started with the API:


    1. Create an API key and secret in the Recommand dashboard

    2. Use Basic Authentication with your API key and secret

    3. Make requests to the available endpoints


    ## Authentication


    All API requests must be authenticated using Basic Authentication. Your API
    key should be used as the username, and your API secret as the password.


    > [!TIP]

    > If you are signed in to the Recommand dashboard in this browser, you can
    use the API client that is embedded below without creating an API key, you
    will be authenticated via a session cookie.


    ## Team and company IDs


    For some endpoints, you will need to provide a team or company ID.


    - You can find your team ID [here](/api-keys).

    - You can find your company IDs [here](/companies).

        Send your document over email as well. You can choose to always send the
        email, or only when we cannot reach the recipient via Peppol. Each sent
        email is counted towards your document quota. When an email is expected
        to be sent, the request will succeed as long as an email has been sent,
        even if the Peppol sending failed (e.g. due to a non-existing Peppol
        address).
