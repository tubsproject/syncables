        Following checks can be triggered:

        **SUPPLIER_ACTIVATION**
        Check performed on: INVOICE
        For invoices received through scan service, checks if the sender has sent electronic invoices in the past and could be contacted to change to electronic sending.


        **BANK_ACCOUNT_CHANGED**
        Check performed on: INVOICE



        **SENDER_BID_STATUS**
        Check performed on: INVOICE
        Checks the invoice sender against national company register to see that the company business ID is registered and active.
        The check also returns information if the company is going through insolvency or bankruptcy proceedings.
        For Finland additional checking that the company is found in the Prepayment register.
        The registries used to get this information, depend on the country of the sender and are as follows:

        Note that if the total amount of value added tax on the invoice is under 1 EUR/NOK/SEK etc., the invoice sender is not checked against the VAT register.
        The registries used to get this information, depend on the country of the sender and are as follows:
        1. Norway - Brønnøysundregistrene [ https://brreg.no ]
        2. EU countries - Vies [ https://ec.europa.eu/taxation_customs/vies/ ]
